# Circuit Noise Simulation

A circuit noise simulation package for my own QEC research usage. 

First draft version: I adapted part of codes from open-source quantum computing packages (Qiskit, QuTip, qecsim) and managed to create a small Python package for $[[4,2,2]]$ circuit noise simulation with non-Clifford rotation gates. 

Future version: Link to `qiskit` and include surface code simulation and decoder
